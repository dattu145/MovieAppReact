  # 🎬 Movie App - React
  
  A Movie App built with **React** that allows users to browse movies, search for specific titles, and save their favorites.  
  This project demonstrates core React concepts including **page routing, state management, Context API, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)**, and API integration with **TMDB**.
